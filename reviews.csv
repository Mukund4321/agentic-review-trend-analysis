"I ordered food from Swiggy, but the app is showing that the order has been delivered even though the delivery partner did not deliver it to me. Without delivering the order, the delivery partner marked it as “delivered” in the app. When I tried to call the delivery partner, there was no response. After that, I contacted Swiggy’s support team. They also tried to call the delivery partner, but he did not answer their calls either. I then emailed the support team, but they were unable to help me",2025-12-25

Also you have the worst customer support team , the issues are never resolved the help support in the app glitches and doesn't works properly. Your customer support team only has one answer to all the inconveniences that they are sorry . Its Disgusting",2025-12-25

There was no proper communication or accountability. After waiting for nearly 3 hours, the order was finally cancelled without any resolution. This has happened repeatedly, and it’s extremely frustrating to waste so much time with false delivery promises. Such poor service is unacceptable from a food Deliveryapp",2025-12-25

"Very bad experience. I faced a lot of issues during my 7 years of journey here. 😟😔 Here are some serious issues I remember from that time: 1. A delivery partner was not assigned many times. 😠 2. My waiting time increased repeatedly after my order. 😤 3. Customer care contact number is not available. 😡 4. Very bad response to emails. They never reply about the problem and always repeat the same line: ""Rate the restaurant."" 🤦‍♀️",2025-12-25

Restaurant was closed and my children slept hungry. I suggest everyone instead of relying on them, make certain arrangement at home.Pathetic",2025-12-24

By the time the food arrived, it was completely cold and ruined. On top of that, there was no proper customer support available in the app to report the issue or get help. False delivery promises and lack of support show very poor service standards. This experience has seriously reduced my trust in Swiggy. Needs major improvement.",2025-12-24

"Literally the worst experience ever. In the past 3 months, whenever I ordered food from Swiggy, it got delayed and the food was also cold. Also, when I tried reaching the delivery partner, his number was unavailable. It was not the first time that this happened, but it has happened every time. If you are not able to deliver within the timeline you stated, it's better not to set an expectation. You are not even delivering an adequate level of service. Literally PATHETIC EXPERIENCE",2025-12-24

"the app says food will be delivered in 20 min and when order is placed this 20 min becomes 1 hr to deliver the food, when you call up the delivery guy he says my order is not yet placed in the restaurant and it will take time to be delivered and when I cancel the order I have to bare the charges,why?",2025-12-24

"Frstly, it gets absolutely nuts if u're user without Swiggy One....since they would charge u to breathe but it doesn't end there. U'll buy Swiggy One, then U'll see Platform Fee (for platform that gets crashed frequently, making it risky during payments) & finally u get ur order placed which was showing 32 min is suddenly showing 55 min (bcoz u didn't paid for faster delivery) but wait, you can't pay for faster delivery now or cancel as it'd be 100% cancelation fee even seconds after payment.",2025-12-24

"SWIGGY STEALS HALF THE PRODUCT and packs the box. Instamart started cheating, by sending partial products and charging in full. When complained, they simply say sorry with no replacement / refund / resolution. It's your fate that you got partial product because of store person mistake and leave with it. AND LASTLY THEY SHOW COMPLETE DADAGIRI OF NOT REPLACING OR REFUNDING !!! No point of sending email to any id, as would be suggested on review, as the response is of no use. SWIGGY GOONS !!!",2025-12-24

I am not sure who was the great man who designed the app for delivery food on rail and missed to update the timings and stations if a train gets delayed. and being an Indian who doesn't know that trains in India gets delayed very often.
